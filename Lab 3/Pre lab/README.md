# Instructions
The following is a 16 bit ripple carry adder created using 4 bit ripple carry adder. Please follow the recommended steps:
1. First design a half adder.
2. Then create a 4 bit ripple carry adder (in a new source file) by instantiating the half adder previously created.
3. Then create a 16 bit ripple carry adder (in a new source file) by instantiating the 4 bit RCA previously created.

# Precautions
1. Make sure that all three source files are within the same project otherwise your RCA will not be synthesized.
2. Make sure that your 16 bit RCA source file is the top module by all means.
